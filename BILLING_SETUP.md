2. Go to **Billing** → **Settings**
3. Enable billing for your application
4. Connect your payment provider (Stripe recommended)

### 2. Create Subscription Plans

Navigate to [Plans](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) and create your fan club tiers:

#### Example Plans:

### 3. Add Features to Plans

For each plan, create features that define what users get:

### 4. Configure Plan Settings

When creating plans:
- ✅ **Publicly available**: Enable this so plans appear in the `<PricingTable />`
- ✅ **User plans**: Make sure these are set as user plans (not organization plans)
- Set appropriate pricing and billing intervals

## 🖥️ Implementation

### Pages Created

1. **`/pricing`** - Main pricing page with `<PricingTable />` component
2. **`/exclusive`** - Example protected content page demonstrating access control

### Components Added

#### Pricing Page (`app/pricing/page.tsx`)
- Space-themed pricing table with custom styling
- Integrates Clerk's `<PricingTable />` component
- Custom CSS to match your cosmic aesthetic
- Navigation back to main site

#### Protected Content (`app/exclusive/page.tsx`)
- Demonstrates server-side access control using `auth().has()`
- Different content for different subscription tiers
- Proper fallbacks for non-subscribers

### Navigation Added
- Link from main hero page: "🚀 Join the Fan Club"
- Back navigation from pricing page: "← Back to Mission Control"
- Preview link from pricing to exclusive content

## 🔒 Access Control Examples

### Server-Side Protection
```tsx
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function ProtectedPage() {
  const { has } = await auth()
  
  // Check for specific plan
  const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'premium' })
  
  // Check for specific feature
  const hasDirectMessaging = has({ feature: 'direct_messaging' })
  
  if (!hasPremiumAccess) {
    return <div>Premium subscription required</div>
  }
  
  return <div>Premium content here</div>
}
```

### Client-Side Protection with `<Protect>`
```tsx
import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function ComponentWithProtection() {
  return (
    <Protect 
      plan="premium"
      fallback={<div>Premium subscription required</div>}
    >
      <PremiumContent />
    </Protect>
  )
}
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Pricing Table Styling
The pricing table has been customized with:
- Dark cosmic theme matching your portfolio
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Custom hover animations
- Indigo accent colors (`#4f46e5`)
- Your logo integration

### Theme Consistency
All billing pages maintain the space theme:
- Starfield animations
- Cosmic gradients
- Your "N" logo branding
- Fan club terminology throughout

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Plans
Before going live:
1. Create test plans with $0.01 pricing
2. Test subscription flow end-to-end
3. Verify access control works correctly
4. Test plan upgrades/downgrades

### Example Test Plan Names:
- `basic_test` - Basic Explorer (Test)
- `premium_test` - Premium Space Traveler (Test)
- `vip_test` - Cosmic VIP (Test)

## 🚀 Going Live

1. **Replace test plans** with real pricing
2. **Update plan names** in code to match your live plan names:
   ```tsx
   // Update these in app/exclusive/page.tsx
   const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'your_actual_premium_plan_name' })
   const hasBasicAccess = has({ plan: 'your_actual_basic_plan_name' })
   ```
3. **Test payment flow** with real payment methods
4. **Set up webhooks** for subscription events (if needed)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Plans not showing in PricingTable**

   - Check plan is set as "User plan" not "Organization plan"

2. **Access control not working**
   - Verify plan names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Check user has active subscription
   - Ensure features are added to plans

3. **Styling issues**
   - Check CSS specificity in global styles
   - Verify Clerk component class names haven't changed
